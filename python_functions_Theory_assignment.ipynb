They are an efficient way to handle data since they yield items one at a time and can be paused and resumed, using less memory than traditional methods of creating lists, especially for large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",

When the generator function is called, execution starts at the beginning of the function and continues until it hits a yield statement, which returns a value and pauses the function’s state. The next time the generator is called, it resumes execution right after the yield statement."

        "  Low Memory Footprint: Generators yield items one at a time and only produce values on demand, so they don't require all outputs to be stored in memory simultaneously. This is especially advantageous when dealing with large data sets or infinite sequences.\n",

        "\n",
        "  - Lazy Evaluation\n",
        "  On-Demand Processing: Generators compute their values lazily. They generate values only as needed, which can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when dealing with large computations or when the total number of iterations may not be known beforehand.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Improved Performance\n",
        "  Reduced Overhead: Since generators compute values as they are requested rather than in bulk, the initial overhead of setting up the entire dataset is avoided. This can lead to faster performance in certain scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Simplifies Code\n",
        "  Readable Code: Generators encapsulate the iteration logic within the same function that generates the values. This leads to cleaner and more maintainable code compared to using standard functions or concurrent structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Elimination of Temporary Lists: You can avoid creating temporary lists or collections that are usually required in iteration, which simplifies your algorithm's design.\n",

        "  - Infinite Sequences\n",
